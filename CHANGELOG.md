# Changelog

Consumers pin this repository by revision. A bare revision says nothing
about what it contains, so every revision meant to be pinned gets an
annotated tag and an entry here naming the contract versions it carries.

Five values decide whether a given revision is the one a consumer wants.
Each entry states all five, and `scripts/check-release-markers.sh` fails
the build when the newest entry disagrees with the code it describes — a
changelog that has to be checked against the source is the archaeology
it was written to remove.

| Value | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| State ABI | `abi::v6::VERSION` in `indicate-instrument-state` |
| Scene format | `SCENE_FORMAT_VERSION` in `indicate-instrument-scene` |
| Corpus | `corpusVersion` in `corpus/scene-conformance-corpus.json` |
| Composition digest | `BUILTIN_SCENE_DIGEST` in `indicate-instrument-panels` |
| Panel set | `BUILTIN_PANELS` in `indicate-instrument-panels` |

A release is cut whenever any of the five moves. Entries are newest
first, and the tag's message carries the same five values so
`git show <tag>` answers the question without a checkout.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-07

First tagged revision. The contract surfaces already versioned
themselves individually; this is the first marker that says which
*combination* a commit carries.

| Value | This release |
|---|---|
| State ABI | 6 |
| Scene format | 1 |
| Corpus | 4 |
| Composition digest | `bd85b8537f0b3e4abf8cf3ad3d36c6abfdceac15355639af2804d58dd9c61931` |
| Panel set | `pfd`, `hsi`, `monitor` |

Panel set changed since the previous release: n/a, this is the first.

### Notes for anyone re-pinning

- Crates are now named `indicate-*`. A consumer advancing a pin across
  this release changes every crate name in its manifest. Revisions
  before it keep the old names, so nothing breaks mid-history.
- The composition digest is **unchanged** by the rename: it was
  `bd85b853…` before and after, because the digest domain separator is
  an identifier and was deliberately not renamed. A consumer that pins
  the digest does not need to re-verify against this release.
- The required-layer table in `scene-layer-protocol.md` was corrected to
  match the shipped descriptors: the PFD requires `Guidance`, and the
  monitor panel has a row. No descriptor changed, so no digest moved —
  the document was wrong, not the code.
