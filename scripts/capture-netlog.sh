#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Captures a bounded Chrome netlog while driving the viewer, for QUIC-layer
# forensics on a transport incident (stalled video, wedged connection).
#
# Three properties this enforces, each learned from a capture that lacked it:
#
#   1. A SIZE BOUND. Chrome writes a netlog until the disk fills; an
#      unbounded capture of a stream-per-frame video session reached 1.6 GB
#      in under an hour. --net-log-max-size-mb keeps it to a stated ceiling.
#   2. A CAPTURE MODE that defaults to the LEAST sensitive setting that
#      still names transport events. IncludeSensitive records cookies,
#      auth headers, and session credentials in plaintext, so it is opt-in
#      (--sensitive) and the file is written 0600 either way.
#   3. A PATH INSIDE target/, never the home directory, so captures are
#      gitignored, pruned here, and thrown away with the build tree.
#
# Chrome ignores these flags when it attaches to an already-running
# instance, so this always launches a DEDICATED instance with its own
# throwaway profile. Your normal browser session is untouched.
#
# Usage: scripts/capture-netlog.sh <viewer-url> [--sensitive] [--max-mb N]
#        Ctrl-C (or closing the window) ends the capture and flushes it.
